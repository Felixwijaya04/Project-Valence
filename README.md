## 🔴About
**Project Valence** is a 2D shooter platformer game where you're infiltrating a mutant animal research lab. Advance further down the laboratory, and neutralize multiple mutants along the way with different weapons you can purchase by defeating mutants.

Steel yourself up, carefully plan, and don't let them win.

I must correct this. No one else have been successful in getting anywhere near them. I must... for their sake.</blockquote>
